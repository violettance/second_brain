## ⚠️ **Test Isolation Note**
- **Component testleri tek tek çalışıyor** ✅ (her biri 0 hata)
- **Birlikte çalıştırıldığında cleanup sorunları** ❌ (HappyDOM + @testing-library uyumsuzluğu)
- **Çözüm**: Test isolation iyileştirmesi veya jsdom'a geçiş gerekli

## Test Writing Guidelines

1. **File naming**: Use `*.test.ts` or `*.test.tsx` format
2. **Test groups**: Organize with logical `describe` blocks
3. **Test names**: Descriptive and in English
4. **Mock usage**: Mock external dependencies
5. **Cleanup**: Clean up after each test

## Mock Strategy

- **Supabase**: All Supabase calls are mocked
- **API Calls**: External API calls are mocked
- **Logger**: Console output suppressed during tests
- **Date/Time**: Use fixed date/time values for consistency

## Coverage Targets

- **Minimum**: 80% coverage
- **Target**: 90%+ coverage
- **Critical files**: 95%+ coverage (hooks, utilities)

## Test Categories

### Unit Tests
- Individual function/component testing
- Mock external dependencies
- Test edge cases and error conditions

### Integration Tests
- Hook + Component combinations
- API integration testing
- Cross-module interactions

### E2E Tests
- Full user workflows
- Real browser testing
- Performance testing

## Dependencies

- **Bun Test Runner**: Fast, built-in test runner
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe test development
- **Mock System**: Built-in mocking capabilities
